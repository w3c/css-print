# CSS Print Community Group

This is the repository of the [W3C’s CSS Print Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/cssprint/).

## Raising Issues

As the work of this group is likely to involve raising issues on specifications from other groups, and on user agents we can use [Issues](https://github.com/w3c/css-print/issues) in this repo to discuss print-related issues. We can then triage them and make sure things are raised in the right place.

## Meetings

This group was formed after the CSS Print Workshop held at XML Prague on 13th February 2020.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.
